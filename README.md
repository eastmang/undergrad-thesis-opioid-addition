# Purpose

---

This work was done to investigate the causal effect of marijuana legalization on the opioid epidemic. Many states have 
been legalizing, and since this work was originally done in 2019, more states have legalized. 
Below is a map of all the legal states at the time this work was done.

By utilizing a triple-differences model (a version of difference-in-differences) in combination with TEDS-A data this 
work finds that legalization significantly reduces the rate of admittance for opioid abuse. 

# Data and Models

---

This work used data from the Treatment Episode DataSet -Admissions, or TEDS-A. This is a federally made and maintained dataset
on all treatment facilities that have taken federal funding. The money is essentially free as long as the facilities
record information on those admitted (de-individualized)nearly all US facilities are in this data. 

This work used a difference-in-differences model to garner a causal estimate. This model is reasoned through by the idea
that if there are two areas following the same trends and one has a policy applied to it while the other does not, the 
difference in trends is the causal effect of that policy. To test this assumption a pre-trends is supplied below.

The trends all move similarly and should be enough to get a useful estimate. Additionally, since states all apply marijuana
policies at different times, it is unlikely that there is other legislation that passed at the same time as those bills
that could also cause a mitigating effect. A more thorough defense of the DID assumptions is given in the paper in this
repo. 

# Analysis

This work found that legalizing marijuana led to a statistically significant decrease in opioid abuse. Additionally,
it performed a subsample analysis for the african-american community which demonstrated a larger magnitude drop in opioid
addiction from medical legalization. These findings are discussed more in depth in the paper. Below is a graph that shows
the drop of admittance for opioid addiction in the year around a state legalizing marijuana.
